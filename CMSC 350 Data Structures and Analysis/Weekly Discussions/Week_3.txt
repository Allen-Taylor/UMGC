Discuss an application that requires an unordered collection of elements. 
An example of an application could be a “bowl of candy”. The order of a bowl of candy doesn’t matter, it is usually a random assortment of brands and flavors. 
Indicate whether and set or bag would be the appropriate data structure. 
Bags (aka Lists in Java) can contain duplicate items unlike Sets which can only store unique elements. The appropriate data structure for my program would be a List, specifically a LinkedList. 
Then decide what implementation was be most beneficial, an array list or a linked list. 
From my research, ArrayLists are good when retrieving data, but slow when it comes to Add/Remove/Edit functions. The opposite is true of LinkedLists. In small collections, the difference in speed isn’t noticeable. Only when you reach collections with millions of elements/items can you notice the speed difference. 
In my application, I would say that a LinkedList would be better because it would focus on Adding/Removing from the collection.
Decide whether that list should be sorted or unsorted. 
The list would be unsorted due to the nature of the program. A person could grab a piece of candy from the unsorted bowl.
